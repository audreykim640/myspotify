The goal of `myspotify` is to to read personal Spotify data and complete a series of analyses. Spotify is a popular music and podcast streaming app globally.

## What's this package for?

Spotify, a popular music streaming platform, offers users the option to download their personal usage history data. `myspotify` seeks to provide tools to allow users to read and visualize their data to learn more about their listening habits. The idea is somewhat similar to "Spotify Wrapped," a personalized summary that Spotify releases annually, but this can assess history beyond just a year and allows the user to delve into the patterns of the songs they listen to on Spotify.

## Who should use this package?

Anyone who uses Spotify, wants to learn more about their listening habits, and has a basic background in (or is willing to learn!) R.

“Basic background” might include understanding variable assignment (`<-`) and various Tidyverse packages like dplyr and ggplot2. Tidyverse familiarity is not necessary but would allow for more data exploration opportunities.

## How to install this package?

```{r loading packages, include=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("audreykim640/myspotify")
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(myspotify)
```


You can install the development version of myspotify from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("audreykim640/myspotify")
```

## What datasets are there?

-   `extended_example`: example dataset of Spotify listening history from one of the authors
-   Load your own!
    -   After loading the package and downloading your data from Spotify and read the files into R (instructions [here](https://github.com/audreykim640/myspotify/blob/main/vignettes/myspotify.Rmd))

## Example data

```{r example_data}
extended_example %>% 
  head()
```

## Example function uses

```{r examples_pt1} 
#Search for a specific word or phrase in a song name 
#Returns a data frame

search_word(extended_example, "Christmas")

# Returns all songs streamed with "Christmas" in the title
```

```{r examples_pt2}
# Make a plot of the top ten artists/bands you have streamed of all time

most_played_artists(extended_example)
```


## Note about testing

There's a test for the dataset in this package, but the rest of the package (functions) return plots. We did not write tests for these, as the suggested package, `vdiff`, does not exist for our working version of R.
