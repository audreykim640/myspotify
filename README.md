The goal of `myspotify` is to to read personal Spotify data and complete
a series of analyses. Spotify is a popular music and podcast streaming
app globally.

## Purpose

Spotify, a popular music streaming platform, offers users the option to
download their personal usage history data. `myspotify` seeks to provide
tools to allow users to read and visualize their data to learn more
about their listening habits. It functions similarly to “Spotify
Wrapped,” a personalized summary that Spotify releases annually.

## Target Audience

Open to all Spotify users willing to wait a few days to receive their
data! (Account type doesn’t matter.)

## Installation

You can install the development version of myspotify from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("audreykim640/myspotify")
```

## Project phase 3 proposal

We propose to expand this package to include more functions that allow
users to take a deeper dive into their listening habits with
visualizations and summary statistics: e.g., more customization in
existing functions, viewing top artists/consumption habits, habits over
time, patterns in listening habits.
